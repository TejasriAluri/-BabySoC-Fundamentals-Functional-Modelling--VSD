# 🧠 Week 2 Task – BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling

## 📌 Objective  
To build a strong foundation in **System-on-Chip (SoC)** fundamentals and understand the role of **functional modelling** using tools like *Icarus Verilog* and *GTKWave*, through the BabySoC learning framework.

## 📝 1. What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?  

A **System-on-Chip** is an integrated circuit that contains **all the essential components of a complete electronic system** on a single silicon chip.  
Instead of using multiple ICs for CPU, memory, and peripherals, an SoC integrates them together — improving speed, reducing power, cost, and size.

### ✨ Key Highlights of SoC:
- 🧮 **Computation** – Performed by the **CPU / Processor Core**  
- 🗂 **Data Storage** – Achieved through **on-chip memory (SRAM, ROM, Flash)**  
- 🌐 **Communication** – Enabled via **interconnect/fabric (buses, NoCs)**  
- 🧰 **Control & Interfaces** – Through **peripherals (UART, SPI, GPIO, timers, etc.)**

📌 **SoC = CPU + Memory + Peripherals + Interconnect**, integrated into one chip.

## 🧩 2. Components of a Typical SoC

| Component        | Role / Description |
|------------------|----------------------|
| **CPU / Core**   | Executes instructions, controls overall operation |
| **Memory**       | Stores program code, temporary data, stack, etc. |
| **Peripherals**  | Provide interface with external world (e.g., UART, SPI, GPIO) |
| **Interconnect** | Bus or network structure that links CPU, memory, and peripherals |

👉 These blocks work together to enable **data flow, processing, and control**, just like different departments in an organization.

##  3. Why BabySoC? (Simplified SoC for Learning)

Real SoCs (e.g., in smartphones) are **highly complex**, with millions of gates and sophisticated architectures.  
👉 For beginners, this complexity makes it hard to grasp **core SoC concepts**.

**BabySoC** is a **minimal, educational SoC model** designed to:
- Break down SoC concepts into **small, understandable blocks**  
- Help learners practice **functional modelling** and gradually move towards RTL & physical design  
- Provide a **clean platform** to experiment and debug using open-source tools

> 📝 *Think of BabySoC as a “mini laboratory” where you can understand how each SoC component fits together before tackling real industrial SoCs.*

## 🧪 4. Role of Functional Modelling in the SoC Design Flow

Before RTL coding and layout, designers create a **functional model** — a high-level simulation of how the SoC behaves logically.

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Functional Modelling** | Abstract simulation (e.g., simple Verilog behavioural code) to verify **system-level behavior** early |
| **RTL Design** | Detailed cycle-accurate coding of individual blocks |
| **Physical Design** | Converting RTL to silicon layout |

🛠️ Using **Icarus Verilog** for simulation and **GTKWave** for waveform visualization allows:
- Early **verification of functionality**  
- Quick **debugging** of integration issues  
- Easier **concept learning** without getting lost in transistor details
